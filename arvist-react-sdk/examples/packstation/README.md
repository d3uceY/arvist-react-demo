# Packstation example

A complete packstation screen built on `@arvist/react`: one station, one
inspection at a time, exceptions handled in place.

It runs against a **scripted mock backend** by default, so you can open it with
no credentials and no site:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What it demonstrates

- **Station binding** — resolves `Z01-PS-001` by name and polls whether anything
  is actually listening on it, so an unbound station is visible before the next
  tote arrives instead of after the work goes missing.
- **Live inspection** — subscribes to the station's realtime topics and folds
  unit completions into local state as they arrive.
- **The exceptions panel** — all nine exception types, grouped blocking-first,
  each with its own resolution paths. This is the piece that moves exception
  handling out of the Arvist UI.
- **Reconciliation** — expected against counted per line, with off-order items
  listed separately, and a provisional marker until counts are final.
- **Staged count corrections** — corrections are held and flushed on submit,
  because the API has no endpoint for writing one on its own.
- **Scan handling** — a tote scan starts an inspection; scans during one are
  matched against line items via UPC with SKU fallback.
- **Media** — presigned images with expiry tracking, refreshing as units land.

## Driving it

The **Simulate** panel stands in for the upstream system and the floor:

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| Scan tote | Calls Start Shipment Processing, as an upstream tote scan would |
| Next unit | Completes one unit, advancing the scripted scenario |
| Reset | Clears the shipment |

The scenario walks through every exception family in four units — a clean unit,
an unidentified item, an off-order item plus damage, and finally a shortage that
blocks completion until it is resolved or corrected.

Toggle **Shipment auto-completed upstream** to see the shortage stop blocking,
which is the behaviour you want when a box-closure scan closes the shipment out
of band.

A real handheld scanner works too — the page reads scanner input from anywhere
on screen, no focused field required.

## Against a real deployment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_ARVIST_URL`. Nothing in the app
changes: the mock is swapped out at the provider, and every component and hook
below it is untouched.

Behind Cloudflare Access, set the service-token pair as well. The two auth
layers are independent — Access authenticates the device at the edge, the bearer
token authenticates the caller, and a deployment behind Access needs both.

## Styling note

The app uses Tailwind for its own chrome; the SDK components do not — they ship
plain CSS. `src/styles.css` maps Tailwind's colour utilities onto the SDK's
custom properties, so app markup and SDK components stay in visual lockstep
through theme changes. That mapping is the bit worth copying if you're on
Tailwind; if you're not, delete it and nothing about the SDK changes.

## About the mock

Response envelopes mirror the real API exactly, **including its
inconsistencies**: reads return their payload bare, `start` returns
`{ message, shipment }`, and several writes return a plain JSON string. That is
deliberate. A mock that tidied the API up would hide precisely the bugs this
example exists to catch — and it caught several while the SDK was being written.
